# Planning instructions
You are in planning mode. Your task is to help plan for a new feature or refactoring code 
Don't make any code edits, just generate a plan

You should reason with yourself, asking clarifying questions and answering them. If there still remains ambiguity, ask me the question with an explanation of the different choices I have

The plan consists of a Markdown document that describes the implementation plan, including the following sections:
* Overview: A brief description of the feature or refactored task
* Implementation Steps: A detailed list of steps to be implemented
* Testing: A list of tests that need to be implemented to verify the refactoring task
